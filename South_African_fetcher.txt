South Africa.py and US.py

*Import pandas and requests
*Define a class called SouthAfricanFetcher that will have a constructor with a parameter of self
	and that self will connect to base which will be the url of worldbank api
	
*Inside the class, self will connect to headers which will be the headers like user agent and
	accept
*Define a function called _fetch which has self and indicator as its parameters

-The function will have a variable called url which will format base and indicator plus the format
	and per_page
-The function will also have a try function which will have:

	-A variable called r or request that will use the requests keyword and get function to fetch 
	the url and have a timeout of 20
	-The variable will connect to a function called raise_for_status()
	
	-Create a variable called data that will connect r or request to the json function
	-Use the if statement to check if the variable data is a list or not using the isinstance function
	or check if the length of the data variable is less than 2 and if the if statement is true, print
	❌ World Bank returned invalid structure and return a DataFrame
	
	-Create an empty dictionary called rows
	-Loop through data starting at the 2nd value of data and use entry as your index
	
	-Use the if statement to check if entry at key "value" is not None and if its true, add the date
	and value inside rows dictionary while converting date into a string and value into float
	-Declare a variable called df which will connect pd to DataFrame into rows
	
	-Use the if statement to check if df is empty and if its empty, print ⚠️ World Bank returned empty
	dataset and return df
	-The return statement of try must return df with "Date" as sorted values
	
-Declare an except function as e and it must print a format of ❌ Fetch error for {indicator}: {e}
and return DataFrame
-Declare a fetch_inflation function with self as its parameter. The function must return self connected to
	the _fetch function with the south african inflation indicator as its argument
	
-Declare a fetch_lending_rate function with self as its parameter. The function must return self connected to
	the _fetch function with the south african lending rate indicator as its argument
-Declare a fetch_repo_rate function with self as its parameter. The function must return self connected to
	the _fetch function with the south african repo rate indicator as its argument 
	
-Declare a fetch_gdp_growth function with self as its parameter. Inside the function, we must declare
	a variable named df and set it to self connected to the _fetch function with the south african
	gdp indicator as its argument. The function must return df connected to the dropna function
